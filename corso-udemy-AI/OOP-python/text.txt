Python is an Object-Oriented programming language:

- Modularity: provides object-based separations of code and behavior

- Extensibility: objects can be extended to include new behaviors and attributes

- Reusability: objects can be reused everywhere in the application

---------------------------------

- classes: are templates for creating objects. We create the variables, functions and the behaviors
           in classes - and then we can instantiate the given class

- objects: are instantiated classes
