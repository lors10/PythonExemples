DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON

Array and lists => lists are basically dynamic arrays (size of array can change) (they are not real arrays)

- Arrays are data structures where all the items are identified with an index (an integer starting with 0).
- The items of the arrays are located right next to each other in the main memory (RAM) - they can be accessed
  by the index
